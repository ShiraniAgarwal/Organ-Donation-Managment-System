## OrganEase – Organ Donation & Transplant Management System

### Overview

OrganEase is a MERN stack–based web application designed to simplify and streamline the process of managing organ availability and transfer between hospitals and procurement centers. The system replaces time-consuming manual communication with a centralized digital platform where organ details can be viewed, requested, and confirmed efficiently.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a real-world healthcare workflow using modern full-stack web technologies, with a focus on usability, accuracy, and faster coordination.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure the following are installed and configured on your system:

* Node.js and NPM
* MongoDB (local setup or cloud cluster such as MongoDB Atlas)
* Environment variables properly configured for database connection

---

### Installation

The project is divided into two parts: **client (frontend)** and **server (backend)**.

From the root project directory, install dependencies for both:

**Frontend setup**

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

**Backend setup**

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

---

### Running the Application

Start the backend server first:

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

Then, start the frontend application in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

---

### Accessing the Application

The application runs locally and can be accessed in the browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

### Features

* Centralized view of available organs across multiple centers
* Organ categorization with relevant medical details
* Hospital-side organ request functionality
* Request confirmation workflow between hospitals and procurement centers
* Secure backend with authentication and database integration
